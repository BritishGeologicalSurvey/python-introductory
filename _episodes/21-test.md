questions:
- "What kinds of data do programs store?"
- "How can I convert one type to another?"
objectives:
- "Explain key differences between integers and floating point numbers."
- "Explain key differences between numbers and character strings."
- "Use built-in functions to convert between integers, floating point numbers, and strings."
keypoints:
- "Every value has a type."
- "Use the built-in function `type` to find the type of a value."
- "Types control what operations can be done on values."
- "Strings can be added and multiplied."
- "Strings have a length (but numbers don't)."
- "Must convert numbers to strings or vice versa when operating on them."
- "Can mix integers and floats freely in operations."
- "Variables only change value when something is assigned to them."

## Every value has a type.

*   Every value in a program has a specific type.
*   Integer (`int`): represents positive or negative whole numbers like 3 or -512.
*   Floating point number (`float`): represents real numbers like 3.14159 or -2.5.
*   Character string (usually called "string", `str`): text.
    *   Written in either single quotes or double quotes (as long as they match).
    *   The quote marks aren't printed when the string is displayed.
